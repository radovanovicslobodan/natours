# Notes from Udemy Course Advanced CSS and SASS

### Process of building CSS sheet
- Block Element Modifier - BEM
    ```css
        .block {};
        .block__element {}; /* two underscores */
        .block__element--modifier {};
    ```

### What is SASS?
- CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS
- Called preprocessor because a compiler is needed to change it to CSS code
- Two syntax methods, SASS and SCSS, SCSS is used in this course
- Features [Link to CodePen](https://codepen.io/zolkocarbon/pen/XEmJJg) using all examples below
    + Variables: for reusable values such as color and font size
    ```scss
    $color-primary: #f9ed69; //comment in SASS
    ```

    + Nesting: nest selectors inside one another
        ```scss
        .navigation {
            list-style: none;
            float: left;

            li {
                display: inline-block;
                margin-left: 30px;

                &:first-child {
                margin: 0;
                }

                a:link { //translates to .navigation li a:link {}
                @include style-link-text($color-text-dark);
                } 
            }
        }
        ```
    + Operators: for mathmatical operations inside CSS (example below in [Functions]("#functions"))
    + Partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and import them all into one single file
    + Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code
        ```scss
            @mixin clearfix {
                &::after {
                    content: "";
                    clear: both;
                    display: table;
                }
            }

            nav {  
                @include clearfix
            }
        ```
        A mixin with an argument
        ```scss
            @mixin style-link-text($color) {
                text-decoration: none;
                text-transform: uppercase;
                color: $color;
            }

            .btn-hot:link {
                @include style-link-text($color-text-light);
            }
        ```
    + <span id="functions> Functions: like mixins, with the difference that they produce a value for later use </span>
        ```scss
        @function divide($a, $b) {
            @return $a / $b;
        }

        nav {
            margin: divide(60, 2) * 1px;
        }
        ```
        SASS also features built-in functions. [Link to list](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html) of built in fuctions.
    + Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them
    + Control directives: for writing complex conditionals and loops (not covered in this course)
